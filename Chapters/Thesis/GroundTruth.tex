\chapter{Ground Truth}\label{ch:groundtruth}
In this chapter we introduce a ground truth to establish that both black-box analysis from \autoref{ch:Blackbox} and white-box analysis from 
\autoref{ch:Whitebox} conceptually work. 

To do so we design multiple configurable systems that test both analyses in different scenrios, afterwards we evaluate
them using \hyperref[researchQuestions]{research questions \ref*{researchQuestions}}. Since we design these systems ourselves we have 
a baseline that we use to manually build a \perfInfluenceModel for each system. All the different system will be designed with different focuses in mind
such as, a system that includes multicollinearity to see in what extent they influence the analyses.
