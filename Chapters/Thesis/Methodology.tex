\chapter{Methodology}\label{ch:methodology}

In this chapter we will explain the reasoning behind the choice of our research questions. 
Furthermore, in \autoref{ch:operationalization} operationalization, we formalize how we evaluate these research questions. 
We then proceed in \autoref{sec:ground-truth}, to establish a ground truth, which tests both white-box analysis and black-box analysis in 
different scenarios.
