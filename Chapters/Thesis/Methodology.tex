\chapter{Methodology}\label{ch:methodology}

%Intro into chapter
In this chapter, we introduce our research questions. 
Furthermore, we formalize how we evaluate the research questions and explain how we measure and collect data for our evaluation.
We then proceed in \autoref{sec:ground-truth} to establish a ground truth, which tests both white-box analysis and black-box analysis in 
different scenarios to identify weaknesses. Last, in \autoref{ch:Research-setup}, we explain the experiment setup we choose to evaluate both analyses.
