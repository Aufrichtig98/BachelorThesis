\chapter{Methodology}\label{ch:methodology}

%Intro into chapter
In this chapter, we introduce our research questions. 
Furthermore, we formalize how we evaluate these questions and explain how we measure and collect data for our evaluation.
We then proceed in \autoref{sec:ground-truth} to establish a ground truth, which tests both white-box analysis and black-box analysis in 
different scenarios to test both analyses and identify weaknesses.
