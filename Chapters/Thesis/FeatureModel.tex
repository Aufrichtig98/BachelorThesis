\subsection{Feature Models}\label{ch:Feature-Model}

%Reason for Feature model
%MAYBE ADD MORE CONTENT NOT SURE WHAT
A configurable system often contains numerous features and different dependencies.
However, not all features are freely combinable, some of them can only be selected when another is deselected. 
The large the system the harder it gets to keep all these constraints in mind \cite{Feature-Oriented-Software-Product-Lines}, 
therefore we use \emph{Feature Models}
to describe the relation between features by that and define which feature selections are valid~\cite{Feature-Oriented-Software-Product-Lines}.

%Reason why featuremodel
Due to the fact that large configurable systems tends to have numerous feature we use feature diagrams which are a common
visual representation of feature models.
