\subsection{Feature Models}\label{ch:Feature-Model}

%Reason for Feature model
A configurable system often contains numerous features, all of which may interact with one each other or have different dependencies.
However, as mentioned in \autoref{feature-config} not all features are freely combinable, some of them can only be selected in the
absence of others. The large the system the harder it gets to keep all these interactions in mind, therefore we use \emph{Feature Models}
to describe the relation between features and define which feature selections are valid~\cite{Feature-Oriented-Software-Product-Lines}.

%Reason why featuremodel
Due to the fact that large configurable systems tends to have numerous feature we use feature diagrams which are a common
visual representation of feature models.
