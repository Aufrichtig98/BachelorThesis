\section{Features and Configurations}

In the previous section we already said that we want to be able to turn functionality on and off, to achieve this we use features.

During the years there have been many definitions to what a feature is, on one side, features are used as a means of communication between
the different stakeholder of a system, where on the other hand, a feature is defined as an implementation-level concept. 

To incorporate both concepts Apel et.al. \cite[p. 18]{Feature-Oriented-Software-Product-Lines} introduced us to the following definition:

"a structure that extends and modifies the structure of a
given program in order to satisfy a stakeholder's requirement, to implement and
encapsulate a design decision, and to offer a configuration option"

Thus, a feature is both an abstract concept that refers to particular functionality of a system and the implementation of that functionality.
