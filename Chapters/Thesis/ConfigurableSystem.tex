In this section, we start of explaining the general concepts behind configurable systems and the reason for using them. 
We proceed with explaining what a feature and configuration is in \autoref{feature-config}. 
Additionally, we introduce functional and non-functional properties in \autoref{ch:properties} and show the difference between them.
