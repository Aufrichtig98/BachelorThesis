In this section, we explain the general concepts behind configurable software systems and the benefits and challenges when using them. 

We explain what a feature and configuration is in the context of configurable software systems in \autoref{feature-config}. 
We introduce functional and non-functional properties in \autoref{ch:properties} and highlight differences between them.
