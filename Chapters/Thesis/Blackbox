\chapter{Black-box Model}\label{ch:Blackbox}
%************************************************

We refer to something as a black-box model when we the user are not aware of the inner workings of the system, like the name suggests we are
in the dark on how the system works, for all we know is that given a by us defined input a black-box transform that into a result according to 
what the system is suppose to do. 

One of the more prominent example for a black-box system are neural networks, they start of with a problem
and exampels on how to solve them, during multiple iterations the network improves itself and is able to solve the problem its designed for
more efficiently and accurately. While we are aware on what the neural network is solving, if we would step into the
code wo wouldnt be able to understand the structure and reasoning behind the decisions and how the neurons interact with one another \cite{NeuralNetworks}.

Since we do however compare black-box and white-box model with each other we need to do that on the same systems, therefore
 we cannot choose black-box system for our experiments, since if we would do so the white-box model would not be able to any produce data.
 We solve this problem by choosing a commonly available white-box system, such as xz, but even though we have acess to the code we dont use
 that knowledge and look at the system from a black-box view.
