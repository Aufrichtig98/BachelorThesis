\chapter*{Acknowledgments}
First and foremost, I would like to express my gratitude to both of my advisors {\myAdvisor} and {\myOtherAdvisor}. 
Both supported me in their best capacity and gave me helpful criticism and good feedback. 
I would especially like to thank them for being patient and responding quickly to my questions, even after regular working hours.
I couldn't have found better advisors to accompany me through this thesis.

Second, I would like to thank my friends Lukas Abelt, Nils Alznauer, Alexander Rogovskyy, and Karl Schrader,
who proofread this thesis and provided suggestions and feedback.
