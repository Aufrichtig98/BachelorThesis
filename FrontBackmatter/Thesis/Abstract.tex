\chapter*{Abstract}
Nearly all modern software systems are configurable. To give the end-user flexibility each system include various configuration options.
However, it is not clear to the end-user how these configuration options might interact and influence properties such as performance. 
For this reason, we investigate this by using two different analyses, a white-box analysis and a black-box analysis. 
To present the influence of each configuration option and interaction between them using {\perfInfluenceModel}, which we use 
to compare and evaluate both analyses.

In this thesis we analyze, 5 different configurable software systems we engineered and the compression tool \textsc{XZ} using both white-box analysis
and black-box analysis.
